Create two stacks: forwardStack and backStack

Function visitPage(url):
    // Clear forwardStack as we are visiting a new page
    clearStack(forwardStack)
    
    // Push the url onto backStack
    push(backStack, url)

Function goBack():
    // If backStack is empty, there are no pages to go back to
    if isEmpty(backStack):
        return "Cannot go back, no pages in history"
    
    // Pop the top page from backStack
    currentPage = pop(backStack)
    
    // Push the current page onto forwardStack
    push(forwardStack, currentPage)
    
    // Load the previous page (the top page of backStack)
    loadPage(currentPage)

Function goForward():
    // If forwardStack is empty, there are no pages to go forward to
    if isEmpty(forwardStack):
        return "Cannot go forward, no pages in history"
    
    // Pop the top page from forwardStack
    currentPage = pop(forwardStack)
    
    // Push the current page onto backStack
    push(backStack, currentPage)
    
    // Load the next page (the top page of forwardStack)
    loadPage(currentPage)

Function clearStack(stack):
    // Pop all elements from the stack until it becomes empty
    while !isEmpty(stack):
        pop(stack)

Function loadPage(url):
    // Load the page with the given URL in the browser
